RPSyntaxHighlighter is a easy to use, fully extensible syntax highlighting library for iOS. It was built with a few ideas in mind:

1. **Ease of use:** it should be easy to highlight and process code in your app. This is why we use `NSAttributedString`s which can be displayed in most UIKit controls as of iOS 6.
2. **Extensibility:** The language definitions and themes used by RPSyntaxHighlighter are simple JSON files. This means it's easy to add extra languages or design a theme that matches your app.
3. **Simplicity:** The entire RPSyntaxHighlighter codebase consists of three classes, meaning it's easy to understand what's going on. It's also fully documented with [appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/).

**Note:** RPSyntaxHighlighter is currently still in development and not yet ready for use in your code.
